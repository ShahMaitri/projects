Problem Statement

Create a tab based Android application, with 3 tabs.
In tab 1, use location manager to detect & show the current location
(reverse geo-coded to address) of the user.
In tab 2 , show the distance travelled, by the user, from the time the app
was opened (assuming the user is moving as this can be simulated in the
Simulator) and show a notification when the user has travelled 50 mtrs.
Please note that the notification should be visible even when Tab 2 is NOT
the active tab.
In tab 3, maintain a list of all sessions in which the user travelled more than 50
mtrs (display day, date & time once the user reached 50 mtrs mark). This list
should be persistent and should be pre-populated, even between launches.
ie. if user has travelled 50 mtrs once and closed the app, next time when he/she
opens it, they should see that record in tab 3
